* EBAS2BAS
Transform .ebas files to .bas files by adding line numbers, and turning labels (~label_name) into line numbers, and some other helpful transformations.

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC
node ebas2bas.js <.ebas filename>
#+END_SRC

You can omit the ".ebas" extension. The output will be the the same name, but with a ".bas" extension.

** Transformations

*** Line numbers & labels
#+BEGIN_SRC
   ~top
   print "i am the best ";
   goto ~top
#+END_SRC

 compiles to:

#+BEGIN_SRC
   10 print "i am the best";
   20 goto 10
#+END_SRC

*** Support for hex and binary numbers

 Converts hex and binary numbers to decimal

#+BEGIN_SRC
   0x1f -> 31
   0b111 -> 7
   0b1000_0001 -> 129
#+END_SRC

*** Comments

Comments with "#" are removed from the source code (You can still use REM comments if you want them to stay).

#+BEGIN_SRC
   poke 0xD020,1 # Make border white -> poke 53280,1
#+END_SRC

*** Multi line source

Most BASIC programs jam many statements onto a single line. To keep the source readable, you can use multiple lines - then any ending with ":" will be concatenated.

#+BEGIN_SRC
   for n=0 to 62 :
     read q :
     poke 0x340+n,q :
   next
#+END_SRC

 compiles to:

#+BEGIN_SRC
   10 for n=0 to 62 :read q :poke 832+n,q :next
#+END_SRC
